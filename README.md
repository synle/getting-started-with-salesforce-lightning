# Getting Started With Salesforce Lightning
===========================================


## What is Force.com?
- A collection of tools for developers provided by Salesforce, can be used to build epic apps in the Salesforce ecosystem. Things include Apex (a variation of Java language) which can be used to write server side logics or talking to Salesforce API using SOSL or SOQL.



## Tools you need to get started.
- Syncing your code from force.com: using either [Mavenmates](http://mavensmate.com/) or [Force.com cli](https://force-cli.heroku.com/). They are all decent tools, works for all platforms: Mac, Linux and Windows. Force CLI is a great tool if you plan to do all your works from the command line. Mavenmates has great integration for Sublime, Atom and Visual Studio Code. For force cli, there is a plugin for Sublime called [Sublime Lightning](https://github.com/dcarroll/sublime-lightning) which provides great integration with force cli

- Your editor of choice: can be Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio code (your call) or even VIM. But with Vim, things will get tricky with the integration (you can use force cli to push your changes to force.com).
